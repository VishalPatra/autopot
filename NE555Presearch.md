# NE555P is a Single percision timer IC.  #

### Modes ###

## 1.Astable Multivibrator ##
# It has actually no stable state. It has two quasi stable states which rapidly alters from one to another and again to the same state. So it mainly alters from high to low and from low to high irrespective of any input trigger input after a pre settled time. #
## 2.Monostable multivibrator
### It has actually no stable state. It has two quasi stable states which rapidly alters from one to another and again to the same state. So it mainly alters from high to low and from low to high irrespective of any input trigger input after a pre settled time.
## 3.Bistable Multivibrator
### Out of two states, one is stable state and another one is quasi stable state. When a trigger input is given, it switches from a stable state to quasi state and it automatically switches back to the stable state after a pre-decided time.
